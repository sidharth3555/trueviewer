first we removed all the routes from aap.js and 
pasted it in routes folder
then we imported those routes in our aap.js folder

now removed all the common parts from all routes like /listings

then aap.use is used to join common parts in all links for example
see ==
aap.use("/listing", listings);//after importing all the routes from line no 19 we will join the routes with /listings AS,

in aap.js folder
